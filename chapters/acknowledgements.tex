\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This work would have been difficult to finish without the support of many people. I want to thank anyone who has lent a hand in the completion of this work in any way. Special thanks go to my supervisor Dr. Jamil Raza whose guidance and assistance helped a lot in the completion of this project. For me as someone completely new to the concepts of information theory, it was a great help. Thanks also to Syed Masood for his occasional help and continued moral support. I also want to thank my parents, siblings and friends especially Haseeb Hayat for their continuous moral support, and my teachers whose guidance throughout my life has made this possible.
